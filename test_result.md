# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

         - Auto-initialization on startup
      
      2. ML Model Integration:
         - aqi_forecaster.py: Loads XGBoost ensemble (5 boosters)
         - source_attribution.py: Loads Random Forest regression model
         - Graceful error handling when models not found
         - Clear logging with emoji indicators
      
      3. API Endpoints Updated:
         - /api/aqi/forecast: Async ML prediction with aqi_24h, aqi_48h, aqi_72h
         - /api/aqi/sources: ML-based source attribution
         - /api/model/transparency: Dynamic status based on model availability
         - Response models include error/message fields for not_loaded state
      
      4. Dependencies Added:
         - xgboost==2.1.3
         - sqlalchemy==2.0.36
      
      5. Documentation Created:
         - /app/backend/ml_models/MODEL_SETUP.md (comprehensive guide)
         - /app/backend/ml_models/model1/README.md
         - /app/backend/ml_models/model2/README.md

      🔄 CURRENT STATUS:
      - Backend running successfully
      - Models NOT loaded (awaiting file upload)
      - prediction_type: "not_loaded" for both models
      - API endpoints return clear error messages
      - System stable and ready for model files
      
      📋 NEXT STEPS:
      1. Update frontend Prediction page to show ML model status notice
      2. Test backend endpoints with model not loaded state
      3. User needs to upload model files to /app/backend/ml_models/model1/ and model2/
      4. After upload, restart backend: sudo supervisorctl restart backend
      5. Verify models load with prediction_type: "ml"
      
      💡 KEY FEATURES:
      - NO simulation fallback - pure ML or error response
      - All OpenWeather dependencies removed
      - Database ready for prediction logging
      - Model paths configurable via environment variables
      - Comprehensive error messages guide user on setup
